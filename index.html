  <p><h3>PRIVACY POLICY FOR ENERGYXP</h3><br>

At EnergyXP, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to the EnergyXP educational application and explains what information it collects, how that information is used, and the measures we take to ensure its security.

Our educational app is designed to provide a safe and secure learning environment for all users.

<h3>Information and Data Gathered by EnergyXP</h3>
EnergyXP collects the following types of non-personal, anonymous data to facilitate educational program delivery and improve our services:

Educational Testing Data: Anonymized quiz scores, question responses, and usage statistics. This data is collected solely to improve the educational content and app functionality.
Program Administration Data: Participant School, Grade Level, and Scheduled Group ID for program administration and authentication purposes. This data does not contain personal identifiers.
Sessions are matched to a scheduled school / group so that program managers can aggregate results across School Districts and States, not at the individual level.
This data is used solely to improve the educational content and app functionality.

<h3>How We Use Test Data</h3>
The anonymized test data collected is used solely for the following purposes:
Program Authentication and Management: To match users to their scheduled school/group for program administration.
Educational Personalization & Improvement: To analyze and improve the effectiveness of our educational materials and enhance the user experience by identifying areas for app improvement.
Aggregate Analytics & Reporting: To generate aggregate, non-identifiable reports for internal use, such as reporting learning improvement to participating school districts. This data is never used to identify individual users.

<h3>Data Sharing & Non-Collection of Personal Data</h3>
Authentication and Test Data are sent/received via Salesforce API for private, internal usage and reporting. No other analytics are captured or shared externally.

EnergyXP does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as names, age, email addresses, contact details, or device identifiers. All data remains anonymous and cannot be traced back to any individual user. We do not collect location, contacts, or photos.

<h3>Data Security</h3>
We take data security seriously and implement appropriate measures to protect all collected test data from unauthorized access or disclosure. Our app is designed for internal use by  authorized program administrators and developers, and its installation is restricted to program-approved devices. We utilized secure protocols, including HTTPS, for data transmission.

Users (students, schools) may request deletion of their data through their participating program manager (EnergyXP administrator). Please note that permission for data collection (as outlined here) is established before participating in our program.


<h3>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h3>
EnergyXP is designed exclusively for educational purposes and operates on an anonymous data collection model. We do not collect any personal information from children or users of any age, as no personal information is collected at all by our app.
